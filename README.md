DNN API for Coriander

This repo acts as both:
- demonstration of creating plugins for [Coriander](https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander)
- partial implementation of cuDNN API

Note that you need the branch [pluggable](https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander/tree/pluggable) of Coriander, for the time being.

## Installation

- first, install the [pluggable branch](https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander/tree/pluggable) of Coriander
- then run `cocl_plugins install --repo-url https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander-dnn`
